The Gaming Room wanted to create a game based off of the tv show Win, Lose, or Draw. They wanted the game to be available on multiple platforms. Something I did particularly well for this document was explaining topics in detail. I think what made working with this document was completing it in sections. Having everything outlined before going into it made revisions much easier to view. Something that could be better is the development requirements section. Some of the operating systems are unfamiliar to me so knowing exactly what each in does every scenario was difficult. I could definitely go into more detail in explaining each. The user's needs are the most important part of developing software. They are the people that will be using the product down the line so taking their suggestions is important. Incorporating their suggestions was simple and helped in developing the product. For designing software in the future, I will use a software design template. It broke the project down into simple steps that can be used to create the actual project down the line.
